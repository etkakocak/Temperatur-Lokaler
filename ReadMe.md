# Project Title: Temperatur Lokaler

## Abstract
This project is about using a ``Raspberry Pi Pico W`` to automatically measure temperature and humidity using a ``DHT11 temperature sensor``. The goal of the project is to reduce the need for human labor by displaying the data on a website that has a ``Python program as back-end``. The project meets the requirements of measuring the temperature and humidity every hour and displaying the results on a website.  

## Background and idea
We were suppose to ``transfer the data received from a hardware to a website and to display it``. ``Datacake`` was allowed for the website, but those who wanted could also ``create their own website``. I had already transferred data from a hardware to Datacake in a task before the project and I did not want to do the same thing again for this project, instead I chose the difficult path and ``transferred the data to a website I created myself``. The front-end of the web page is quite simple. The purpose of the project was not to create a beautiful website, but to provide ``data flow between the web page and the hardware``. Website:

The project was a group work and I worked together with my friend.   
This project got a ``grade G`` with the IG/G/VG grading system.
